# Linear Regression Model: GDP Per Capita vs. Life Satisfaction
## Overview
This project involves a simple linear regression model that explores the relationship between a country's GDP per capita and its life satisfaction rate. The aim is to determine how well GDP per capita can predict the life satisfaction score of a country.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains two key variables:

- GDP per capita: The economic output per person in a country.
- Life Satisfaction Rate: A survey-based score reflecting people's satisfaction with life.
### Model Description
The model applies linear regression to establish a linear relationship between GDP per capita (independent variable) and life satisfaction rate (dependent variable). The output is a line that best fits the data points.

### Steps:
#### Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and preparing the data (handling missing values, scaling if necessary).
#### Training:
Using GDP per capita as the predictor for life satisfaction, a linear regression model is trained.
#### Evaluation:
The model is evaluated using standard metrics like R-squared to check how well the model fits the data.
